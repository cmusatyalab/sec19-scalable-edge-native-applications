Contact: Anton Chechetka (antonc.work@gmail.com)

The application collects the following data:
* Camera videos.
* Fine-grained location from GPS.
* Acceleration from built-in phone accelerometer.
* Rotation velocity from built-in phone gyroscope.

The data is written to local files (mp4 for the video and JSON for all the other sensor) on the device. The app does not send any information over the internet or other connections. All the post-processing of the data needs to be done manually by the user. Data collection is necessary as recording such data on the device is the core purpose of the app.
